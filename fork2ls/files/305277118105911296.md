## Introduction
Homer is an all-in-one Discord bot designed for all communities. It was born in April 2017 under the name *iBot*.  
The bot uses [discord.js](https://discord.js.org) as API wrapper and runs on the [node.js](https://nodejs.org) runtime engine.  
**Note:** I do not provide ***any*** help for self-hosting.  

## Main features
- **Basic commands**: Information about user, role, server or channel - Google, YouTube and weather search - Reminder and polls 
- **Lisa tags**: Based on [JagTag](https://github.com/jagrosh/JagTag), create advanced custom commands to enhance user experience  
- **Telephone**: Get your own telephone line, manage your contacts list and start calling people!  
- **Radios**: Listen to some worldwide radios in your voice channel, start with `h:radio help`  
- **Multilingual**: Currently available in English and French, awaiting for translations in your languages!
