YouTube is one of the best YouTube-related Discord bots on Discord. Itâ€™s goal is to provide statistics, upload notifications, and way more- and it does that perfectly!

The bot can alert you when your favourite YouTubers go live or upload, and you can get near-instant information about video, channels and playlists, from a partial or full search, URL or ID.

More is coming soon, and suggestions are welcome.
