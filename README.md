# DiscordForkAppdata
Application data for Discord_Fork

[Invite the bot](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=473861594749861909&permissions=0&scope=bot)

## How to use
Send JSON to any channel with the DiscordForkAppdata bot.
Any valid JSON will work, as long as the `for` field is filled in with the correct domain.
```json
{
    "for": "https://discordbots.co.uk",
    "botCount": 2138
}
```

The client may visually disrupt the JSON.
However, the JSON text has not been disrupted, and can still be read by the bot.
